**Description:**
This program is a simple tool that will extract all files from each folder in the same directory and group the said files
by file type into folders. The reason I made this program was to easily group my large list of folders containing roms of many
different file types into folders by their given file type. This allows me to easily place all my roms into their correct
folders on my emulation system, I hope others can find use of this too!

**A note on file setup:** 
To ensure this program will work as intended please make sure you only have all the folders you wish to be
organized and this progam in a folder. It is also important to note that this program will extract all files from each folder
and then delete the said folder, if any folder has sub folders it will simply extract those as well and not organize them
into file type folders but rather leave them in the root folder.

**How to Use:**

1. Create a new folder
2. Place groupByFileType.ps1 in the new folder
3. Place all your desired folders to be organized into the new folder
4. Run groupByFileType.ps1
